OVERVIEW
SIMPLEGEN works by separating the generation of epidemiological data from the generation of genetic data. Epi data is stored in the form of a "transmission history", which must follow an exact specified format and essentially is a complete record of who infected whom. To generate genetic data, the user specifies the IDs of individuals to sample from at a particular time point. The transmission history is then pruned down to just the historical events that ultimately influence these individuals. Finally, genetic data can be generated from the pruned infection history using some additional parameters.

SIMPLEGEN will work with transmission histories generated from *any* model, just as long as the final format is correct, however, a fairly complete transmission model is included in the program.

TRANSMISSION MODEL
The SIMMPLEGEN transmission model is closely aligned to the Griffin model, but also has some key differences both in assumptions and implementation. The model is designed to be a minimally sufficient description of the transmission cycle, capturing the majority of important features that are required for simulations to match observed data, but otherwise leaving out details. It is also designed to be maximally flexible, allowing the user to specify complete distributions (e.g. of duration of infection) where possible. Finally, the code is written in a way that prioritises readability and ease of extension rather than focussing exclusively on efficiency.

The most important concept in the model is the separation of 1) the human infection state, 2) each individual infection that a human receives, referred to as an "innoculation", and 3) the genotypes within an individual. For most transmission models these are
