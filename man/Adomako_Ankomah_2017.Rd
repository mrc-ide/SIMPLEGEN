\description{
Data from Adomako-Ankomah et al. (2017). Here we give a brief summary of the
data - see the original paper for full details.
\cr
\cr
A longitudinal cohort study was conducted in a seasonal and high-transmission
area of Mali, in which 500 subjects aged 1â€“65 years were followed for 1 year.
Blood samples were collected every 2 weeks. Multiclonality of Pf infection was
measured using a 24-SNP DNA barcoding assay at 4 time-points (two in wet season,
and two in dry season).
