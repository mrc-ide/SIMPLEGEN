Title: Simulating Plasmodium Epidemiological and Genetic Data
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Forwards-in time simulation of Plasmodium falciparum genetic data can be
    computationally intensive, as many genotypes are tracked but ultimately lost. SIMPLEGEN
    avoids this problem by splitting simulation into three steps - first, simulating
    transmission under a simple individual-based model, second, pruning the infection history
    to focus on nodes that contribute to the final sample, and third, simulating genetic data.
    A secondary advantage is that any third-party epidemiological simulator can be used for
    the first step as long as it outputs in the correct format. The major limitation of SIMPLEGEN
    is that assumes the epidemiological and genetic processes are seperable, and hence is limited
    to neutral variation, and cannot model selection.
