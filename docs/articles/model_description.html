<p>The first step in the SIMPLEGEN pipeline is to simulate from an epidemiological transmission model. Any transmission model can be used, just as long as it can produce output in a standardised format, but an inbuilt transmission model is also included with the program to make life easier. This inbuilt model is designed to be as simple as possible but no simpler - it does not attempt to be a complete phenomenological description of the malaria life cycle. It is also designed to be highly flexible, allowing multiple types of model to be defined with the same framework.</p>
<p>This vignette gives a high-level description of the inbuilt transmission model.</p>
<div id="inoculations-and-host-states" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#inoculations-and-host-states" class="anchor"></a>Inoculations and host states</h3>
<p>The most important concept in the model is the idea of an “inoculation”, defined here as a population of parasites that are passed from mosquito to human host upon successful infection. Each host within SIMPLEGEN can be thought of having multiple inoculation “slots”, and each new inoculation falls into a new slot. There are a finite number of slots available per host, defined by <code>max_inoculations</code>, but for most applications we can set this number to be large enough that hosts never saturate all their slots.</p>
<p>Each inoculation can be thought of as an independent episode of malaria that goes through the following stages: 1) liver stage, 2) acute blood-stage, 3) chronic blood-stage, 4) recovery. Inoculations can pass through all four stages in order, or they can pass directly from 1) to 3) or from 2) to 4), depending on the model parameters. The acute stage essentially represents the symptomatic stage of infection, although the word “acute” has been used rather than “symptomatic” to avoid forcing a clinical interpretation on the model. The chronic stage is designed to capture long-lasting infections, including possible asymptomatic and/or sub-patent stages (more on detection later).</p>
<p>The state of a host is defined directly from the state of its inoculations. If there are <strong>any</strong> acute inoculations then the host is in the acute state. Otherwise, if there are <strong>any</strong> chronic inoculations then the host is in the chronic state. Otherwise, if there are <strong>any</strong> liver stage inoculations then the host is in the liver state. Otherwise the host is in the susceptible state. Thus, the state of the host roughly corresponds to the <em>most serious</em> of the inoculations it holds. This can be seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>, which shows the host state for a simple case of two overlapping inoculations.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong> The host carries two inoculations, each of which goes through liver stage and acute and chronic stages before clearing naturally. The host state is dictated by the inoculation states.
</figcaption><p></p></font>
<p>The only host state that is not dictated directly from its inoculations is the treated (aka prophylactic) state. Treatment is described fully in a later section, but in simple terms treatment causes all blood-stage infections to clear immediately. Liver-stage infections are not cleared, i.e. treatment does not represent a radical cure. After treatment the host enters a prophylactic state in which new liver-stage infections can occur, but any inoculations leaving the liver within the prophylactic period are immediately cured. Eventually the prophylaxis wears off and the host transitions back into the susceptible state. <strong>Figure 2</strong> shows another example of the host state being computed from the states of the inoculations, this time for a more complex case involving treatment.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrc-ide/SIMPLEGEN/master/R_ignore/images/inoc_diagram2.png"><font size="2">
<figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong> After a period of time the host is treated and enters a prophylactic state. During this period a new liver-stage inoculation takes hold, but this leaves the liver within the prophylactic period and is therefore immediately cured. A second liver-stage inoculation occurs within the prophylactic period, but this time leaves the liver outside the prophylactic period and so proceeds as normal.
</figcaption><p></p></font>
<p>Given the description above, we can now visualise the model in a classical compartmental structure. <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows the possible states and transitions of both individual inoculations and hosts.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong> Inoculation states and host states. Dashed arrows indicate transitions that are only possible via super-infection.
</figcaption><p></p></font>
<p>Notice that there are no rates or parameters on any of the arrows in <strong>Figure 3</strong>. This is because state durations and transition probabilities are modelled using flexible distributions, described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="flexible-distributions" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#flexible-distributions" class="anchor"></a>Flexible distributions</h3>
<p>In a standard compartmental model there is a constant probability of moving between states, leading to exponential waiting times in each state. In SIMPLEGEN the user can define probability distributions in a more flexible way, allowing probabilities to vary from one inoculation to the next. For example, the <code>prob_infection</code> parameter specifies the probability of an infectious bite taking hold, leading to a new inoculation. If this is defined as a vector then the first value is used for the first infectious bite, the second value for the second bite, etc. until the final value which is used for all remaining bites. Hence, infection-blocking immunity can be modelled by using a vector of decreasing probabilities. Similarly, the <code>duration_chronic</code> parameter can be input as a single vector, in which case it specifies the daily probability of leaving the chronic phase, or as a list of vectors, in which case the model steps through the distributions for each new inoculation.</p>
<p>The following parameters can be defined in a flexible way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>prob_infection</code>: the probability of infection, given a bite from an infectious mosquito</li>
<li>
<code>prob_acute</code>: the probability of going to acute stage vs. directly to chronic stage</li>
<li>
<code>prob_AC</code>: the probability of an acute infection going to chronic stage on recovery vs. directly to susceptible</li>
<li>
<code>duration_acute</code>, <code>duration_chronic</code>: the duration of acute and chronic infection</li>
<li>
<code>detectability_microscopy_acute</code>, <code>detectability_microscopy_chronic</code>: detectability by microscopy in the acute and chronic stages. Analogous parameters exist for detectability by polymerase chain reaction, replacing <code>microscopy</code> by <code>PCR</code> in the above</li>
<li>
<code>time_treatment_acute</code>, <code>time_treatment_chronic</code>: the time until <em>considering</em> seeking treatment in the acute and chronic stages (more info on treatment below)</li>
<li>
<code>duration_prophylactic</code>: the duration of post-treatment prophylaxis</li>
<li>
<code>infectivity_acute</code>, <code>infectivity_chronic</code>: the onward infectivity of the acute and chronic stages</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="treatment" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#treatment" class="anchor"></a>Treatment</h3>
<p>Treatment is the exception to the rule that inoculations are independent. Upon treatment, all blood-stage inoculations are immediately cured, and the host enters a prophylactic stage in which no new inoculations are possible. Liver stage inoculations are not directly cured, but inoculations that leave the liver stage while the host is in the prophylactic stage are considered immediately cured. Sexual stages are not directly cured, although the termination of the diseased stage will lead to the termination of the sexual stage after the appropriate lag.</p>
<p>The input parameters define both the distribution of duration of disease (acute and chronic), and the distribution of time until seeking treatment. Whichever one of these occurs first takes precedence - in other words, these are competing hazards. If the disease clears naturally first then the host does not seek treatment. If treatment comes first then the host is considered <em>motivated</em> to seek treatment at this point in time, for example due to the emergence of clinical features, although treatment is still not guaranteed. Instead, the host draws whether to access care from its own treatment-seeking probability, <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>. The value of <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is defined separately for each host at birth, and represents long-term factors that dictate a host’s propensity/ability to seek treatment. The value of <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is drawn from a Beta distribution with shape parameters <code>treatment_seeking_alpha</code> and <code>treatment_seeking_beta</code>, allowing the user to define both the mean access to care in the population, and the extent of inequality in access to care.</p>
</div>
<div id="infectivity-and-mosquitoes" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#infectivity-and-mosquitoes" class="anchor"></a>Infectivity and mosquitoes</h3>
<p>The onward infectivity of an inoculation to mosquitoes also goes through acute and chronic stages, which are lagged from the asexual stages. For example, take an inoculation that transitions from liver stage to acute stage on day 20, then to chronic infection on day 40, then recovers on day 100. If the gametocyte lag parameter <code>g</code> is equal to 10 days then the inoculation will enter the acute infective stage on day 30, the chronic infective stage on day 50, and will become uninfective on day 110. The daily infectivity of the acute and chronic stages can be defined flexibly (see above). The overall infectivity of a host is taken to be the <em>maximum</em> of the infectivity of its inoculations.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes exist in three stages: susceptible, latently infected, and infectious. Upon biting an infectious human host and becoming infected, they enter the latent stage which has fixed duration <code>v</code> (the extrinsic incubation period). Upon leaving the latent stage they become infective to humans. Natural death occurs with constant rate <code>mu</code> throughout the mosquito lifetime, and every death is matched with a new birth in the susceptible stage, leading to a constant mosquito population size <code>M</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="demographics" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#demographics" class="anchor"></a>Demographics</h3>
<p>The stable age distribution of hosts is calculated from life tables. If no life table is supplied by the user then values are taken from Mali demographic data by default. Human deaths are matched by new births, leading to a constant total human population size. Only natural death is considered, i.e. malaria does not lead to increased chance of death.</p>
</div>
<div id="migration" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#migration" class="anchor"></a>Migration</h3>
<p>All of the model description above applies to a single epidemiological unit - a single <em>deme</em>. Human migration is modelled as a stochastic process in which hosts move between demes. Migration events are seen as temporary trips of defined duration before returning to the home deme. Hence, migration can capture everything from short trips to nearby villages to long-distance seasonal migration patterns. Mosquito migration is not modelled.</p>
<p>For each deme, the overall probability of migration can be defined as a function of time. This is scaled by a factor that is defined separately for each one-year age group - for example, adults may migrate more than children. Given that migration occurs, the relative probability of migrating to each destination deme is defined using a deme-by-deme matrix, which is also free to vary over time. Finally, the trip duration can be specified between every pair of demes.</p>
