### Watch this space...

**SIMPLEGEN is currently in development and is not yet ready for real analysis sorry!** We hope to have a working release version start of 2024.

SIMPLEGEN is an R package for efficiently simulating *Plasmodium* genetic data. It does this by breaking the simulation process down into a series of steps:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrc-ide/SIMPLEGEN/master/R_ignore/images/pipeline.png" height="185px" width="800px" />

There are several types of models along this pipeline, including epidemiological models, genetic models, and observation models. SIMPLEGEN contains in-built versions of these models that are calibrated against publicly available data. Alternatively you can use your own model, just as long as you follow the same input/output conventions.

If you'd like to know more about the logic behind the SIMPLEGEN pipeline then please [see here](https://mrc-ide.github.io/SIMPLEGEN/articles/what_is_simplegen.html), or if you'd like to jump straight into using the package then please [start here](https://mrc-ide.github.io/SIMPLEGEN/404.html).
