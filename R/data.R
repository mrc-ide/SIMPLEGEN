#' 2014). The first time-point corresponds to a period of high transmission, and

#' using a 24-SNP barcode, and complexity of infection was estimated using the
#' COIL algorithm. Samples were also matched against a large database of
#' previously published and unpublished barcodes. For samples from the low
#' transmission period (2014), one of the three repeated barcode clusters (n =
#' 6) corresponded to a parasite type (haplotype 3), observed in ThiÃ¨s in both
#' 2007 and 2010. The other 2 clusters (IP1, n = 2; IP2, n = 2) had not

#' 24-SNP barcode data showing population structure in Haiti (Charles et al.,

#' 
#' Data from Charles et al. (2016). Here we give a brief summary of the data -
#' see the original paper for full details.
#' \cr
#' \cr
#' Samples were collected through routine surveillance spanning 2006â€“2009 by the
#' Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposiâ€™s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections
#' (GHESKIO) at 9 healthcare centers in various municipalities. Samples were
#' genotyped using a 24-SNP barcode. The paper states that samples that showed
#' >1 mixed-base SNP call or had >5 missing calls in the 24SNP molecular barcode
#' were removed from analysis, however, there is 1 sample (monogenomic sample
#' 24) that has 6 missing calls and has not been removed, and there is also 1
#' sample (polygenomic sample 8) that has exactly 1 mixed-base SNP call and 0
#' missing calls and yet has been removed. Therefore, it is possible that
#' samples were removed if they showed >0 mixed-base calls, or had >6 missing
#' calls (all data presented are consistent with this filtering). Both
#' monogenomic (n = 52) and polygenomic (n = 8) samples are available, although
#' samples excluded based on missingness are not available. Samples were
#' compared in terms of the proportion of shared bases, and were identified as
#' either identical, related, or unique based on this number.

#' with self-reported acute fevers within 24 hours of visiting the clinic and no
#' recent anti-malarial use. Whole blood spots from 2006â€“2011 were preserved on
#' filter paper, and DNA was extracted and characterised using a 24-SNP
#' molecular barcode. Samples were excluded if they had missing data on more
#' than four SNP positions. Samples were identified as polygenomic if they had
#' multiallelic calls at more than one SNP position, otherwise monogenomic. It
#' is unclear whether the data presented is for monogenomic samples only, as one
#' sample (SenT081) has mixed calls at 2 sites and therefore is polygenomic, but
#' it seems unlikely that there was only one polygenomic sample observed in the

#' Dried blood spots were taken from 2012-13 cross sectional surveys in several
#' provinces in Uganda. Households (n = 200) were randomly selected from each
#' province. All samples that had detectable asexual parasitemia were selected
#' for Sequenom SNP genotyping. Medium to high frequency SNPs (n = 128) with
#' high frequency in malaria populations (pf-community-project) were chosen,
#' leaving 105 SNPs after filtering variants with lower or missing frequencies.
#' Genotyping was based on the intensity of the SNPs. In addition, merozoite
#' surface protein 2 (msp2) genotyping was conducted on an age stratified subset
#' of the samples. Capillary electrophoresis was used to distinguish msp2 allele
#' sizes.
#' \cr
#' \cr
#' The data contains a list (size = 3) of data frames. The first data frame
#' contains SNP calls for 105 filtered SNPs. The values \{-1, 0, 0.5, 1\} denote
#' missing value / no call, heterozygous, or homozygous alleles. The second and
#' third data frame contain 95% credible intervals for COI and allele
#' frequencies using their described categorical and proportional methods for
#' modeling homozygous/heterozygous calls and with-in host allele frequency,

#' The study investigates local versus imported transmissions and how that
#' effects the genetic diversity in Eswatini. The parameters collected in the
#' epidemiological model include district of residence, season, case detection,
#' age, sex, and patient occupation. To compare genetic diversity, an 
#' overlapping subset of microsatellite markers were used to compare against
#' other countries with lower transmission rates (it was found that Eswatini had
#' a greater diversity of parasites (mean $H_E$ was consistently higher)). When
#' comparing the local and imported cases, population level diversity did not
#' differentiate greatly; however, a greater portion of local cases were
#' monoclonal and less complex. Differences in MOI and $F_ws$ between cases were
#' statistically significant but had marginal effect sizes and could not be used
#' to discriminate cases. 
#' \cr
#' \cr
#' Eligible cases were identified through Eswatini's national malaria surveillance
#' program. Samples were genotyped using microsatellites from 26 different loci,
#' which showed no selection based on $F_ws$ calculations. In their study, they
#' excluded data points where the probability of there being an allele was less
#' than 95%, but these are included in the data set.
