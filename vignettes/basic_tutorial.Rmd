This tutorial goes through the basic process of creating a SIMPLEGEN project and running the inbuilt epidemiological simulator. 

### Setting up the model

SIMPLEGEN works with projects, which are essentially just glorified lists that hold all inputs and outputs in a single convenient place. We start by creating a new project and specifying the parameters of the epidemiological model:

```{r}
myproj <- simplegen_project()
myproj <- define_epi_model_parameters(myproj,
                                      H = 1e3,
                                      M = 1e4)
```

Alternatively, if you are familiar with the pipe operator `%>%` from the `dplyr` package then you can use this to chain together multiple commands:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

myproj <- simplegen_project() %>%
  define_epi_model_parameters(H = 1e3,
                              M = 1e4)
```

Here we've just specified the human and mosquito population sizes and left all other parameters with their default values. A complete list of model parameters and their defaults can be found in the help for this function (see `?define_epi_model_parameters`).

Taking a quick look at our project we get e a summary of the current setup:

```{r}
myproj
```

We can use our inbuilt plotting functions to explore some of the assumed distributions of our model. For example, we can look at the distribution of time spent in the acute state:

```{r}
plot_epi_distribution(myproj, name = "duration_acute")
```

Many distributions can be explored in this way, and `?plot_epi_distribution` gives a complete list.

Once we're happy with the parameters of the model, the next step is to define the outputs that we expect it to produce. There are three possible types of output:

1. `daily` output contains values for each day of simulation. This can be useful for visualising trends over time.
2. `sweeps` are the same as `daily` output, but evaluated at specific points in time. This can be useful for getting a more detailed snap-shot of the population without overloading the daily output. For example, we might want to return the prevalence in 5-year age bands on day 100, but without returning these values every other day of the simulation.
3. `surveys` represent samples taken from the population according to a predefined sampling strategy. Surveys are the most important type of output from the genetic perspective, as genetic data will only be generated from individuals in the survey.

We specify daily outputs using a basic dataframe. **Table 1** gives the columns of this dataframe along with all possible combinations of values (**Table 1** should be read from left to right, moving into any box not separated by a horizontal line - for example, `state = "A", measure = "count"` is a viable combination, but `state = "A", measure = "EIR"` is not).

</font>

Any number of extra columns can be added to this basic dataframe, for example it can be useful to have a `name` column giving a short description of what each row contains. We can use any standard method to produce this dataframe; the code below uses the `rbind()` method:

```{r}
daily_dataframe <- rbind(data.frame(name = "acute_prev", deme = 1, state = "A", measure = "prevalence", diagnostic = "microscopy", age_min = 0, age_max = 5),
                         data.frame(name = "chronic_prev", deme = 1, state = "C", measure = "prevalence", diagnostic = "microscopy", age_min = 0, age_max = 5),
                         data.frame(name = "acute_inc", deme = 1, state = "A", measure = "incidence", diagnostic = "PCR", age_min = 2, age_max = 10),
                         make.row.names = FALSE)

print(daily_dataframe)
```
Once we're happy with this dataframe we can load it into the project using `define_epi_sampling_parameters()`. At this point any errors in the format will be flagged.

```{r}
myproj <- define_epi_sampling_parameters(project = myproj,
                                         daily = daily_dataframe)
```

The second type of output is sweeps. These can be defined using a second dataframe identical in format to the daily output but with an added `time` column. For example, the following code specifies that we want acute prevalence and incidence in 5-year age bands at day 365:

```{r}
sweep_dataframe <- rbind(data.frame(name = "prev_acute", time = 365, deme = 1, measure = "prevalence", state = "A", diagnostic = "true", age_min = seq(0, 100, 5), age_max = seq(0, 100, 5) + 4),
                         data.frame(name = "inc_acute", time = 365, deme = 1, measure = "incidence",  state = "A", diagnostic = "true", age_min = seq(0, 100, 5), age_max = seq(0, 100, 5) + 4),
                         make.row.names = FALSE)

print(head(sweep_dataframe))
```
Again, this needs to be loaded into the project. Normally we would load all sampling dataframes in one go:

```{r}
myproj <- define_epi_sampling_parameters(project = myproj,
                                         daily = daily_dataframe,
                                         sweeps = sweep_dataframe)
```

The final type of output is surveys. These mainly relate to genetic data, and so will be explored in a later vignette.


### Running the model and extracting results

Once we have specified our model and desired outputs we are ready to run the simulation. This is done using the `sim_epi()` function. Note that the argument `pb_markdown = TRUE` is used here just to avoid cluttering this tutorial with too much output, but you should run the model without this argument.

```{r}
myproj <- sim_epi(myproj,
                  max_time = 365,
                  pb_markdown = TRUE)
```

Taking a quick look at the project we can now see that we have some results:

```{r}
myproj
```

All output from the epidemiological model is stored within the `epi_outputs` element of the project. For example, we can look at the first few daily output values as follows:

```{r}
head(myproj$epi_output$daily)
```
Notice that the format of this dataframe is identical to what we loaded in, but now replicated over all `time` points and with an added `value` column. We see a very similar thing when we look at the sweep output:

```{r}
head(myproj$epi_output$sweeps)
```
Having outputs in long format like this is not always the most efficient in terms of space, but is very convenient when it comes to plotting and summarizing results.


### Plotting results

One of the most basic plots that we might be interested in is the daily number of hosts in each state. We can specify the states that we want to plot as an input vector:

```{r}
#plot_daily_prevalence(myproj, state = c("A", "C"), diagnostic = "microscopy")
```

This is also true of mosquito states, which are suffixed with "v":

```{r}
#plot_daily_states(myproj, states = c("Ev", "Iv"))
```

In addition to storing daily counts in each state, the `sim_epi()` function takes a slice of the population at various times, allowing us to plot age-distributions at these points in time. The sampling times are specified by the argument `output_age_times`, which defaults to the final timepoint only. Hence, we can plot:

```{r}
#plot_age_states(myproj, state = "C")
```


### Multiple demes and migration

SIMPLEGEN allows for multiple sub-populations (also called demes), which can be perfectly isolated or connected by migration. First, we specify the human and mosquito population sizes in each deme by using a vector of values for `H`, `M`, and `seed_infections`. Second, we specify a migration matrix giving the daily probability of each human moving from the source deme (rows) to the destination deme (columns).

```{r}
# define parameters over multiple demes
n_demes <- 3
H <- rep(1e3, n_demes)
seed_infections <- c(1e2, 0, 0)
M <- c(1e3, 2e3, 3e3)

# define a migration matrix
m <- 0.01
mig_mat <- matrix(m / n_demes, n_demes, n_demes) + diag(1 - m, n_demes)

# load new paramters into the model
myproj <- define_epi_model_parameters(myproj,
                                      H = H,
                                      seed_infections = seed_infections,
                                      M = M,
                                      mig_mat = mig_mat)

myproj
```

Then define sampling parameters

```{r}
myproj <- define_epi_sampling_parameters(myproj)
```

We then run the simulation as normal:

```{r}
myproj <- sim_epi(myproj, pb_markdown = TRUE)
```

Now when plotting results we can use the `deme` argument to specify which deme to plot:

```{r}
#plot_daily_states(myproj, states = c("A", "C", "P"), deme = 1)
#plot_daily_states(myproj, states = c("A", "C", "P"), deme = 2)
#plot_daily_states(myproj, states = c("A", "C", "P"), deme = 3)
```

In the example above there are three demes, with only the first containing infected hosts initially. As time progresses we  see infections seed into the other two demes via migration.
