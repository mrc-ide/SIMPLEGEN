This tutorial goes through the basic process of creating a SIMPLEGEN project and running the inbuilt epidemiological simulator. 

### Setting up the model

SIMPLEGEN works with projects, which are essentially just glorified lists that hold all inputs and outputs in a single convenient place. We start by creating a new project and specifying the parameters of the epidemiological model:

```{r}
myproj <- simplegen_project()

m <- 0.1 
mig_mat <- rbind(c(1 - m, m), c(m, 1 - m)) 

myproj <- define_epi_model_parameters(myproj,
                                      H = 1e3,
                                      M = 0,
                                      seed_infections = 0,
                                      mig_mat = mig_mat,
                                      migration_probability = c(1., 1.))
```

Here we've just specified the human and mosquito population sizes and left all other parameters with their default values. A complete list of model parameters and their defaults can be found in the help for this function (see `?define_epi_model_parameters`).

Taking a quick look at our project we get e a summary of the current setup:

```{r}
myproj
```

We can use inbuilt plotting functions to explore some of the assumptions of our model. For example, we can look at the distribution of time spent in the acute state:

Many distributions can be explored in this way, see `?plot_epi_distribution` for a complete list.

Once we are happy with the parameters of the model, the next step is to define the outputs that we expect it to produce. There are three types of output:

1. `daily` output contains values for each day of simulation. This can be useful for visualising trends over time.
2. `sweeps` are the same as `daily` output, but evaluated at specific points in time. This can be useful for getting a more detailed snap-shot of the population without overloading the daily output. For example, we might want to return the prevalence in 5-year age bands on day 365, but without returning these values every other day of the simulation.
3. `surveys` represent samples taken from the population according to a predefined sampling strategy. Surveys are the most detailed and important type of output, as genetic data will only be generated from individuals in the survey.

We specify daily outputs using a basic dataframe. **Table 1** gives the columns of this dataframe along with all possible combinations of values.

This table should be read from left to right, moving into any box not separated by a horizontal line - for example, `state = "A", measure = "count"` is a viable combination, but `state = "A", measure = "EIR"` is not.</figcaption>
</font>

Any number of extra columns can be added to this basic dataframe and will simply be ignored by the software, for example it can be useful to have a `name` column giving a short description of what each row contains. We can use any standard method to produce this dataframe; the code below uses the `rbind()` method:

```{r}
daily_dataframe <- rbind(data.frame(name = "count", deme = c(1,2), state = "H", measure = "count", diagnostic = NA, age_min = 0, age_max = 120),
                         make.row.names = FALSE)

print(daily_dataframe)
```
Once we're happy with this dataframe we can load it into the project using `define_epi_sampling_parameters()`. At this point if there are any errors in the format they will be flagged.

```{r}
myproj <- define_epi_sampling_parameters(project = myproj,
                                         daily = daily_dataframe)
```

The final type of output is surveys, but these mainly relate to genetic data and so will be explored in a later vignette.


### Running the simulation

Once we have specified our model parameters and outputs we are ready to run the simulation. This is done using the `sim_epi()` function. Note that the argument `pb_markdown = TRUE` is used here just to avoid cluttering this tutorial with too much output, but you should run without this argument. In the example below we run the simulation for 10 years of output:

```{r}
myproj <- sim_epi(myproj,
                  max_time = 3650,
                  pb_markdown = TRUE)
```

Taking a quick look at the project we can now see that we have some output:

```{r}
myproj
```

All output from the epidemiological model is stored within the `epi_outputs` element of the project. For example, we can look at the first few daily output values:

```{r}
head(myproj$epi_output$daily)
```
Notice that the format of this dataframe is identical to the daily dataframe we loaded in, but now replicated over all `time` points and with an added `value` column. We see a very similar thing when we look at the sweep output:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
myproj$epi_output$daily %>%
  dplyr::filter(measure == "prevalence") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = value)) + theme_bw() +
  geom_line(aes(color = name))
```


## Run through different probabilities here

```{r}

```
