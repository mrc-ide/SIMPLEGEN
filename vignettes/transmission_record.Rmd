One of the key steps in the SIMPLEGEN pipeline is simulating a *transmission record*. This vignette describes the format of the transmission record and explains the logic behind storing information in this way.

### What is a transmission record?

When we simulate from a transmission model there are typically many thousands or even millions of events that take place. Some of these events have the *potential* to impact the genotypes that we see in our final sample of infected people. This does not mean they definitely *will* impact the observed genotypes, just that that *could* in theory impact them. A good example is a host being bitten by two infectious mosquitoes; this could result in a polyclonal infection if the mosquitoes carry different genotypes, or it could result in a monoclonal infection if the mosquitoes carry the same genotype.

On the other hand, there are many events that cannot impact the genotypes we see in our final sample. One example is a human host dying, either as a result of infection or from natural causes. If a host dies then by definition it will not make it into our final sample of malaria-positive people, and so, for our purposes, tracking this event would be a waste of time and computer memory.

The purpose of the transmission record is **to keep a record of all events that have the potential to impact the genotypes in the final sample**. We aim to do this **in a computationally efficient way**, retaining only the minimum information required, and also **in a simple and flexible way** to ensure as many models as possible can access the SIMPLEGEN pipeline.

The purpose of the transmission record is *not* keep track of every event in the simulation. We are not aiming to reconstruct the entire simulation from this output, we are just trying to capture the important genetic elements.


### Tracking infections, not genotypes

The transmission record works with *infections*, defined in this context as **a population of parasites passed between human host and mosquito at the point of biting**. A single infection can contain multiple genotypes or a single genotype, i.e. it is a higher level of granularity than a genotype. At the same time, an infection is a lower level of granularity than a malaria episode, which could be made up of multiple infection events. We need this middle ground in order capture things like superinfection, which can have important consequences from a genetic perspective.

This brings us to one of the most important assumptions of the SIMPLEGEN pipeline:

**We assume that the genotypes within an infection have no direct impact on disease progression or onward transmissibility.**

This is a tricky statement to unpack, as it actually allows for quite a wide range of models. In the simplest case we can think of genotypes separated by neutral mutations, i.e. those that confer no selective advantage to the parasite. In this case the frequencies of the different genotypes will drift up and down, perhaps undergoing strong bottlenecking at times, but crucially the relative frequencies will have no bearing on the overall progression of disease (otherwise they would not be *neutral* mutations).

We can also try to think of examples that violate this assumption. We can imagine a model in which a particular allele confers resistance to a commonly used antimalarial drug, thereby increasing the chance that an infection persists even after treatment. Here the presence or absence of the allele directly impacts the progression of the disease, and so we would need to know genotypes at the time of simulating transmission.

Although this assumption limits the kinds of models that can use the SIMPLEGEN pipeline, it does so with good reason. When this assumption is met it means we can separate out the genetic aspect of simulation from the epidemiological aspect, which in turn can have huge benefints in terms of speed and memory requirements. It still leaves the door open to many research and surveillance questions, for example those that rely on patterns of neutral genetic variation, however, there will always be situations where we cannot make this assumption in which case other tools may be more appropriate.

### Working with infection IDs

To make the transmission record we need a way of tracking infections as they move between human hosts and mosquitoes. This can be done quite easily by using three different types of IDs:

1. <span style="color: red;">Human IDs</span>
2. <span style="color: blue;">Mosquito IDs</span>
3. Infection IDs

These IDs are nothing more than numbers that uniquely identify a given person/mosquito/infection. **Figure 1** gives a diagram of an infection being passed from a human host to a mosquito. The human here has ID <span style="color: red;">21</span>, the mosquito has ID <span style="color: blue;">33</span>, and the infection IDs are shown inside the small circles. The human host initially carries infection ID 1, which then becomes infection ID 2 when it is passed to the mosquito. We can say that infection 2 is the *child* of infection 1, and likewise infection 1 is the *parent* of infection 2. There is nothing special ocurring biologically when we move from infection ID 1 to 2, this is just how we choose to label events.

A more complex example is given in **Figure 2**. Here we have several chains of transmission going between human hosts and mosquitoes.

There are several things to note from this diagram:

- Every infection has a unique ID, even infections that are children of the same parent. For example, infections 3 and 4 are both children of infection 1, but they have different IDs to distinguish them from one another (they are different populations of parasites).

- Both humans and mosquitoes can be infected multiple times. In this example human <span style="color: red;">25</span> picks up infections from two different mosquitoes, and similarly mosquito <span style="color: blue;">35</span> picks up infections from two different humans. There is no limit imposed by the transmission record on the number of infections a human/mosquito can receive.

- An infection can have a single parent or multiple parents. In this example infection 12 is the child of parents 8 and 9. This does not mean anything in terms of genotypes or ancestors, at this stage we are just tracking which infections were present at the time of mosquito bite.

This method of tracking infections is simple, yet rich enough to capture some important dynamics such as human and mosquito superinfection.


### The transmission record

Now that we have established some rules for how infections are passed between humans and mosquitoes we can think about how to encode this information. **Figure 3** gives the exact same information as **Figure 2**, but in the form of a table:

<font size="2">

</font>

Again, there a few things to note from this table:

- The *time* column tells us when the infectious bite happened. In this example we have events over five sequential days, but there is no need for time to be sequential in real simulations.

- The *event* column tells us whether this row represents a human being infected from a mosquito (event = 1) or a mosquito being infected from a human (event = 2). These are the only two possible events; if we wanted to represent parasites being passed in both directions in a single bite we would have to use two rows.

- In some cases we might want to represent a new infection entering the population without a parent; for example an infection imported from outside our study population. In this case a value -1 can be used for both the infection ID and the human/mosquito ID. In this example we start with two infected humans (<span style="color: red;">21</span> and <span style="color: red;">22</span>), so these are encoded in the table as two new infections without parents.

This is the most basic format of the transmission record. **Any simulation model that is capable of producing a record like the one above is free to plug into the SIMPLEGEN pipeline.**

There are also some optional columns that can be used to add depth to the transmission record. The first column contains a record of parasite densities. In the example above it appears that infections within a host/mosquito are equivalent - for example infection IDs 8 and 9 within host <span style="color: red;">25</span> appear to be equally important. In reality, one of these infections might contribute far more to the total parasite load, which has implications for the chance of onward transmission. We can accommodate this by storing the relative parasite densities of each infection in an additional *parent_infection_density* column. The values in this column correspond directly to the infections in the *parent_infection_ID* column. Some genetic models might make use of this information while others will not. The second optional field is the *deme*. This stores the deme (i.e. subpopulation) in which the human and mosquito reside at the time of the bite. Sometimes we will not need this information, or our model will be unable to produce it, but in other cases this information will be very important, for example if we want to assume some sort of spatial structure in our model with each location having a different mix of starting allele frequencies. **Figure 4** gives an example of a transmission record with these optional extra columns:

<font size="2">

</font>

Again, there a few things to note from this table:

- Parasite densities are taken as relative values, meaning they can be proportions or absolute numbers.

- Demes are integer numbers and represent the deme in which the bite occurs. In this example host <span style="color: red;">21</span> moves demes between their first and second mosquito bite.

The format of the transmission record is a comma-separated file (.csv), meaning it can be opened and browsed manually if needed, although often the file might become too large to make sense of by eye. The next step will be to prune this record down, which can reduce file sizes dramatically.
