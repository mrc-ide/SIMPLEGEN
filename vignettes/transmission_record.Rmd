The transmission record is
- a record of events in the simulation model

The overall purpose of the transmission record is
- to store the minimum amount of information that permits us to generate genetic data

This step has two inputs:
- the full transmission record of inoculations
- the inoculation IDs corresponding to the sampled hosts
And one output:
- the pruned record

Vignette sections:

- Basic description of record
  - we need to track inoculations not hosts in order to track potential of super-infection and co-transmission
  - figure showing two generations of hosts with intervening mosquitoes and inoculations passing between them
  - side-by-side with text version of record
  
- More complex example involving partial mosquito feeds
  - figure shows mosquito obtaining inoculations from multiple sources, and passing on to multiple hosts
  - another side-by-side text version
  - assumption that feeds occur on same day. i.e. some information is lost, but hopefully justifiable
  
- Pruning
  - sample usually a small fraction of total population. Most of these events have no relevance to sample.
  - transmission model also needs to output the inoculation IDs of the hosts that make up the final sample. This allows us to prune the tree
  - coalescent-style figure showing pruning. Side-by-side with pruned record (and full?)
  - comment on reduction in size. Important as each inoculation will eventually represent a very large amount of information (potentially up to whole-genome scale) so reductions at this stage are welcome.

- Conclusions
  - recap purpose and limitations of trasmission record
  - note that things like migration are subsumed entirely into the record. Once we have the record we don't need to know demes.
